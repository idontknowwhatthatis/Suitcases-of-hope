  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    Suitcases of Hope is a nonprofit based in La Vergne, Tennessee, founded by Cailey Shae Martin. 
    We believe no child entering the foster system should have to carry their belongings in a trash bag. 
    We deliver high-quality suitcases filled with hygiene products, blankets, journals, stuffed animals, and other comfort items to children entering or transitioning within the foster care system.

  <h2>üíº Meet the Founder: Cailey Shae Martin</h2>
  <p><strong>Founder of Suitcases of Hope | Survivor of the Foster System | Advocate for Dignity &amp; Change</strong></p>
  <p>
    Hi, I‚Äôm Cailey Shae Martin, and Suitcases of Hope was born from pain, from resilience, and from a promise I made to myself a long time ago ‚Äî that if I ever got out, I‚Äôd turn around and help the next one behind me.
  </p>
  <p>
    You see, I didn‚Äôt read about foster care in a textbook or hear about it in a documentary.<br>
    <strong>I lived it.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    For over four years, I was part of a system that moved me from place to place. I was just a kid ‚Äî grieving, confused, and trying to understand why the world felt so temporary. I didn‚Äôt always know where I was going. I didn‚Äôt always know if I‚Äôd be welcome when I got there.
  </p>
  <p>
    But I did know one thing for sure: I was never given a suitcase.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every move meant shoving my belongings ‚Äî what little I had ‚Äî into a black trash bag. My clothes, my shoes, my memories, sometimes a photo or two. All stuffed into something meant for garbage. And that‚Äôs exactly how it made me feel.
  </p>
  <p>
    That may seem small, but it leaves a deep mark. It sends a message you carry for years:<br>
    <em>You‚Äôre not worth more than this.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    No child should ever be made to feel that way ‚Äî not when they‚Äôre already losing so much.
  </p>
  <p>
    That‚Äôs why I started Suitcases of Hope.<br>
    Because that story shouldn‚Äôt repeat itself.<br>
    Because children in foster care deserve dignity.<br>
    Because I know what it‚Äôs like to feel invisible ‚Äî and I refuse to let others feel that same silence.
  </p>
  <p>
    We provide new, high-quality suitcases filled with essentials and comfort items to children and teens in the foster care system. But what we‚Äôre really giving is so much more than that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>We‚Äôre giving kids a sense of ownership over their belongings.</li>
    <li>We‚Äôre giving them something they can keep, even when everything else keeps changing.</li>
    <li>We‚Äôre saying: <strong>You matter. You are seen. And you are worth showing up for.</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This mission is deeply personal. Every suitcase we pack feels like I‚Äôm sending love back in time to the girl I used to be ‚Äî scared, hurting, and unsure of what came next. And I hope that every child who receives one knows that someone out there understands.
  </p>
  <p>
    Suitcases of Hope isn‚Äôt just about bags.<br>
    It‚Äôs about restoring worth, offering comfort, and reclaiming stories.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thank you for supporting this mission ‚Äî whether through donations, encouragement, or simply by listening. You‚Äôre helping rewrite the narrative for kids just like me. And together, we are showing them that hope doesn‚Äôt come in trash bags.<br>
    It comes in love. It comes in dignity.<br>
    <strong>It comes in a suitcase.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    With all my heart,<br>
    <strong>Cailey Shae Martin</strong><br>
    Founder, Suitcases of Hope
